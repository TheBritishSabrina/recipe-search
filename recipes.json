    "directions": "homemade chocolate cake takes time, effort and patience... unless you have a mug, 5 minutes and a microwave . this tasty mug cake recipe is simple, easy and can be customized to suit your sweet tooth . chocolate cake in a cup, perfect for a serving size of one, delivers a big treat with a small effort . we like to eat it still warm, with vanilla ice cream . we're also not above \"frosting\" it with nutella or a scoop of peanut butter for rich chocolate peanut butter perfection . can you really bake a chocolate cake in the microwave an entire cake nope but the magic of microwave cookery is in full effect for this single serving recipe it works great for one when you want a quick treat . if you want to double the recipe it'll work just fine, but you'll need to divide the final batter between two mugs and increase cooking time by 15 seconds if you cook both cakes at once . do i need a special kind of cup or mug for this to work all the vessel has to be is microwave safe, more or less mug shaped i.e . not flat, and able to hold 8 ounces . and because the entire recipe is made right in the microwave safe mug, clean up is easy and fast . does it taste the same as a cake baked in the oven this cake is a little different, texture wise . it's a bit denser because the microwaves cook the cake differently than the heat of a traditional oven . the effect is more lava cake, less birthday cake . but what you trade off in texture you get back in speed what other cake gets \"baked\" in less than two minutes this chocolate mug cake is the perfect option when you're craving a delicious sweet treat and don't want to wait 45 minutes . will it really rise doesn't cake need baking powder or baking soda while most cakes require a helpful lift from baking soda or baking powder, in this recipe whisking the egg into the small amount of batter gives it enough puff from the air incorporated into the egg white that the cake still rises . what if i don't have one of the ingredients is this a strict recipe all baking, even when it's done in the microwave, is a more precise than regular cooking because of the chemical reactions involved . however, see the next two questions below for exceptions... mini chocolate chips do i need them must they be mini you can leave out chocolate chips if you don't have any, but using two types of chocolate makes for a richer, more flavorful cake . mini chocolate chips will suspend most evenly throughout the batter . but if you only have regular sized chips, stir a few into the batter and then sprinkle the rest across the top right before you pop it in the microwave . some will sink, but not all . and use whatever kind of chips you like butterscotch is a satisfying counterpoint to the chocolate, as are white chocolate chips, or try peppermint chips during the holidays . do i have to use both brown and white sugar using these two kinds of sugar gives the cake a more complex sweetness and interesting flavor and be sure to gently pack the brown sugar into the measuring spoon for maximum deliciousness and accuracy so, for the best mug cake, use both . but if you only have white sugar, that can work too . is this safe for kids could a child make it while it's always best to have an adult present in the kitchen, this microwave mug cake is an excellent starter recipe for a young cook eager to bake something by her or himself no hot oven or flame on the stove makes it a no worry lesson in following directions, counting, and the wonders of kitchen chemistry . can i customize this cake what if i want to incorporate some mix ins go wild give a nod to chocolate's heritage it's indigenous to latin america and was originally cultivated by the ancient mayans by making a mexican hot chocolate cake add 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and a dash of cayenne to the dry ingredients . or make a s'mores cake stir 1 tablespoon of mini marshmallows into the prepared batter just before baking and serve with graham crackers."

    "directions": "what is a frittata the frittata is the italian cousin to quiche basically a big, veggie packed omelet . the traditional cooking approach often involves stirring, broiling or eek flipping the eggs to make sure it's fully cooked and golden brown . this easy spinach frittata recipe skips the tricky bits instead, the eggs cook all the way through in the oven . what veggies can go into a frittata the frittata is a very flexible dish making one from whatever veggies are in the fridge is a common approach . asparagus, red bell pepper, green onions, and fresh spinach are all delicious . in this recipe, sun dried tomatoes infuse flavor into the eggs and baby spinach rounds out the flavors . it's a flavorful spin on the classic spinach frittata . don't forget at least a pinch of salt and a few good grinds of black pepper . frozen spinach works perfectly as long as you thaw it and squeeze out the extra water before adding it in . for good looks and a punch of bright flavor, you can \"float\" a few grape tomatoes on top of the egg mixture right before it goes into the oven . so...just veggies heavens no . meat, cheese, and milk are all welcome additions . parmesan cheese is the classic flavor booster, but anything you'd put in an omelet works sausage, cheddar cheese, swiss cheese, ham, up to a 1/4 cup of cream or whole milk . if you add bacon, you can skip the salt . if you leave out meat and cheese entirely, you may need up to one teaspoon salt . be sure to cook any meat ahead of time a few minutes in a frying pan on medium heat will do it for bacon . whatever your final mix, ground black pepper is a must have . how to cook a frittata remember to preheat the oven just as soon as you get into the kitchen part of the secret to the gloriously quick cooking time total time of 15 to 20 minutes is high oven heat 425o f . you'll need all of your sundried tomato cutting / egg whisking time for the oven to preheat . pan size is somewhat flexible a 10 or 12 inch cast iron skillet or non stick frying pan is perfect for this . however, if you don't have either, improvise a pie pan, well coated with nonstick spray or olive oil or butter, will also work . an easy make ahead dish there are several different ways to create a make ahead frittata . the simplest cook it the night before and serve it cold straight from the fridge . frittata is one of those rare dishes that tastes good warm, cold, or at room temperature . another make ahead option is to combine the ingredients in a large bowl the day before . store it sealed in the fridge, preheat oven in the morning and pour egg mixture straight into your pan to cook . if grating parmesan before you've had your first or fourth cup of coffee is not for you, having everything prepped the night before can be a lifesaver . is a frittata healthy that depends on what \"healthy\" means to you it's gluten free, high in protein and low carb . it's perfect for a keto diet and see below for a paleo frittata variation, if that's your style . frittata is also vegetarian assuming you don't add meat and an easy way to get your veggies if you fill it with veggies . it's also high fat, because it's chock full of eggs . but you knew that, right a frittata can be made with egg whites or some egg whites and some whole eggs to reduce the fat content . side dishes to serve with frittata what goes well with a frittata something bright and crunchy like a salad, salty like ham, or carby toast or biscuits are all good choices . serve a frittata with bacon and crispy potatoes for a breakfast feast, or with a green salad for a classy weekend brunch . another option is to reflect the veggies in the frittata a tex mex green chile and jack cheese frittata pairs well with sour cream, salsa, and sliced avocado . a feta frittata is perfect with a greek salad full of red onion and olives dressed with lemon and extra virgin olive oil."

    "directions": "whether you're planning a week's worth of lunches, you need weeknight dinner recipes, or a cookout is on the calendar, you can shift from reliable chicken recipes to the elegant pork roast to make things interesting . but what makes this easy recipe interesting isn't just the meat, it's also the rub . dry rubs vs marinades vs sauces dry rub there are a few different options when it comes to adding flavor to meat . if you've never worked with a dry rub before, dry rubs are spice mixtures that act like dry marinades . it adds flavor to the outside and penetrates the inside to create a flavorful, juicy cut . you can buy pre made dry rubs, but one of the benefits of this recipe is that it's made up of spices you probably already have in your cupboard . marinade a marinade is liquid to add flavor . it's typically made with oil, vinegar, citrus juice, or wine, as well as dried herbs and spices . a marinade helps to create a tender cut of meat, and only affects the outside of the cut . it doesn't penetrate the inside, as a rub does . sauce a sauce is also liquid and can add flavor to meat . it's not necessarily used in the preparation of meat it's typically added after the meat is cooked and is ready to be served . while sauces an occasionally be used as a marinade, such as barbecue sauce or teriyaki sauce, marinades are rarely used as sauces . dry rub ingredients while many meat recipes require little more than salt and pepper as seasoning, using a spice mixture can wake up your pork loin . the zesty paprika and fiery cayenne pepper pack a punch, while the brown sugar and sugar bring a subtle sweetness to balance out the heat . feel free to swap out any ingredients you may not like or substitute with whatever you have on hand . for example, you could easily replace the cayenne pepper with chili powder, or the dried thyme with dried rosemary . there are plenty of options to customize this recipe with your favorite dry ingredients . keep in mind that most rubs taste different after they are cooked . you may find the taste of the rub before applying it to the meat very different compared to how it tastes after roasting . now that you know a little more about rubs, it's time to try it out on a pork loin . if you've never worked with pork loin, it's very easy almost as easy as making toast, so you really have nothing to worry about, but there are two things you should know 1. though the safe internal temperature for chicken is 165 degrees fahrenheit, pork is much cleaner, so it can safely be eaten when it reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees fahrenheit . pork is best when it's cooked to this temperature, but you can cook it until it reaches 165 degrees fahrenheit, if that's what you prefer . 2. let the meat rest before slicing . when you let meat rest, the meat draws back some of the liquid that's lost when you slice it immediately . this is a very simple recipe using a simple cut of pork, but the flavors are complex enough that you can serve it at a dinner party or include it with your holiday recipes . in short, it's a pork recipe you'll want to refer to again and again"
